# Package Diagram

The following package-level diagram shows the logical organization of the Study Planning Agent and the dependencies between its main parts.

```mermaid

    subgraph UI["Presentation / UI"]
        CLI["Command-line / future UI"]
    end

    subgraph Domain["Domain"]
        Student["Student"]
        Assignment["Assignment"]
        StudyPlan["StudyPlan"]
        PlanItem["PlanItem"]
    end

    subgraph Agent["Agent Logic"]
        Planner["Future Planner / Agent"]
    end

    subgraph Persistence["Persistence"]
        Store["Future repository / database"]
    end

    subgraph Integration["Integrations"]
        Calendar["Future Calendar Adapter"]
    end

    CLI --> Planner
    Planner --> Domain
    Planner --> Store
    Planner --> Calendar
```

The diagram separates the application into presentation, domain, agent logic, persistence, and integration layers. The planner acts as the central application component, connecting the user interface with the domain model, persistence layer, and external integrations.
