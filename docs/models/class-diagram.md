    class Assignment {

        +date start_date
        +date end_date
        +add_item(item)
        +total_hours()
    }

    class PlanItem {
        +int plan_item_id
        +date scheduled_date
        +float planned_hours
        +string reason
    }

    Student "1" --> "0..*" Assignment : owns
    Student "1" --> "0..*" StudyPlan : receives
    StudyPlan "1" *-- "0..*" PlanItem : contains
    PlanItem "0..*" --> "1" Assignment : schedules
```

The diagram shows that a student can own multiple assignments and receive multiple study plans. Each study plan contains multiple plan items, and each plan item schedules one assignment.
