# Study Planning Agent

**Course:** Software Engineering and AI Agent Fundamentals
**Course code:** GAINBAN-SZOFMEIN-1
**Project type:** Semester laboratory project

## About This Repository

This repository contains the semester project and laboratory artefacts for the Software Engineering and AI Agent Fundamentals course.

The project is developed incrementally. Each laboratory adds software engineering documentation, models, source code, tests, or AI-agent-related components.

## Week 1 - Git Collaboration and AI Agent Fundamentals

Week 1 introduces Git/GitHub collaboration and a deterministic mini-agent simulator.

Topics:

* repository and commit workflow
* task branches
* GitHub Issues
* Pull Requests
* autonomy
* tool use
* memory
* action

### Run the Week 1 Demo

```bash
python lab_agent.py
```

If your system uses `python3`:

```bash
python3 lab_agent.py
```

### Week 1 Output Files

* `lab_agent.py` - observe/decide/act logic
* `agent_memory.json` - persistent memory
* `agent_output.txt` - file-system action produced by the agent
* `notes/week1.md` - project artefact created/managed by the agent

## Development Workflow

The project uses `main` as the stable integrated branch.

For each task or laboratory:

```text
main
  -> create a task branch
  -> make and review changes
  -> git add / git commit
  -> git push
  -> Pull Request
  -> merge into main
  -> git switch main
  -> git pull
```

Do not begin a new laboratory from an old task branch.

## Current Project Status

* Week 1: completed - Git workflow and introductory agent simulator
* Week 2: next - requirements engineering and use-case modeling
